1.1 Purpose of Test Automation In softwaretesting

The purpose of test automation in software testing is to use purpose-built software tools to control and set up test preconditions, execute tests, and compare actual outcomes to predicted outcomes. 


Test automation involves designing the testware, including software, documentation, test cases, test environments, and test data. Test automation has different approaches for interacting with a system under test (SUT), including testing through public interfaces, the user interface, or a service/protocol. 

The objectives of test automation include improving test efficiency, providing wider function coverage, reducing total test cost, performing tests that manual testers cannot, shortening the test execution period, increasing test frequency, and improving system reliability. Success factors in test automation include a test automation architecture (TAA) aligned with the architecture of the SUT, SUT testability, a practical and consistent test automation strategy, and a test automation framework (TAF) that is easy to use, well-documented, and maintainable.

The more success factors that are met, the more likely the test automation project will succeed.The purpose of test automation in software testing is to use purpose-built software tools to control and set up test preconditions, execute tests, and compare actual outcomes to predicted outcomes.

1.1 Purpose of Test Automation

Using purpose-built software tools to control and set up test preconditions
Executing tests and comparing actual outcomes to predicted outcomes
Designing testware, including software, documentation, test cases, test environments, and test data
Implementing automated test cases, monitoring and controlling the execution of automated tests, and interpreting, reporting and logging the automated test results
Different approaches for interacting with a SUT: testing through public interfaces, user interfaces, or a service or protocol
Objectives of Test Automation

Improving test efficiency, providing wider function coverage, reducing the total test cost, performing tests that manual testers cannot, shortening the test execution period, increasing the test frequency/reducing the time required for test cycles
Advantages of Test Automation

More tests can be run per build, possibility to create tests that cannot be done manually, tests can be more complex, tests run faster, tests are less subject to operator error, more effective and efficient use of testing resources, quicker feedback regarding software quality, improved system reliability
Disadvantages of Test Automation

Additional costs are involved, initial investment to set up TAS, requires additional technologies, team needs to have development and automation skills, on-going TAS maintenance requirement, can distract from testing objectives, tests can become more complex, additional errors may be introduced by automation
Limitations of Test Automation

Not all manual tests can be automated, automation can only check machine-interpretable results, the automation can only check actual results that can be verified by an automated test oracle, not a replacement for exploratory testing
1.2 Success Factors in Test Automation

Test Automation Architecture (TAA) closely aligned with the architecture of the software product, designed for maintainability, performance, and learnability
SUT Testability, designed for testability that supports automated testing, testable parts of the SUT should be targeted first
Test Automation Strategy, a practical and consistent test automation strategy that addresses maintainability and consistency of the SUT
Test Automation Framework (TAF), easy to use, well documented and maintainable, supports a consistent approach to automating tests, implement reporting facilities, enable easy troubleshooting, address the test environment appropriately, document the automated test cases, trace the automated test, enable easy maintenance, keep the automated tests up-to-date, retire tests as needed, monitor and restore the SUT
Maintenance considerations: do not create code that is sensitive to the interface, do not create test automation that is sensitive to data changes or has a high dependency on particular data values, do not create an automation environment that is sensitive to the context
Note: Before starting the test automation project, it is important to analyze the chance of success for the project by considering the factors in place and the factors missing, keeping risks of the chosen approach in mind as well as project context.

1.2 Success Factors in Test Automation

Major success factors for test automation include test automation architecture, SUT testability, test automation strategy, and test automation framework
Test automation architecture should be very closely aligned with the architecture of a software product and should be designed for maintainability, performance, and learnability
SUT needs to be designed for testability that supports automated testing
Test automation strategy should address maintainability and consistency of the SUT
Test automation framework should be easy to use, well documented, and maintainable, and should support a consistent approach to automating tests
To establish an easy to use and maintainable TAF, implement reporting facilities, enable easy troubleshooting, address the test environment appropriately, document the automated test cases, trace the automated test, enable easy maintenance, keep the automated tests up-to-date, plan for deployment, retire tests as needed, and monitor and restore the SUT
Do not create code that is sensitive to the interface, do not create test automation that is sensitive to data changes or has a high dependency on particular data values, and do not create an automation environment that is sensitive to the context
Summary:
Test automation is a process of using purpose-built software tools to control and set up test preconditions, execute tests, and compare actual outcomes to predicted outcomes. It involves designing the testware, including software, documentation, test cases, test environments, and test data. Test automation aims to improve test efficiency, provide wider function coverage, reduce total test cost, perform tests that manual testers cannot, shorten the test execution period, increase the test frequency/reduce the time required for test cycles. Success factors for test automation include test automation architecture, SUT testability, test automation strategy, and test automation framework. A good practice is to separate the software used for testing from the SUT itself to minimize interference. However, there are limitations, disadvantages, and risks involved in test automation, such as additional costs, maintenance requirements, and complexities introduced by automation.
